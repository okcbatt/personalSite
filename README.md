<!-- enjoyed the assignment. cant wait to see it evolve as we learn more functionality
also wanted to thank Ed for suggesting coolers. Im super colorblind and that helped picking colors that went together -->

<!-- Week 2 - added flexboxes containing my paragraphs alternating the order between each on (left, right, left) for the about me and the portfolio pages to create a better looking page. Also added a background image rather than a solid color. My name takes you to the "about me" page. Feeling better with how its looking after week 2 than week 1! -->

Week 3 - added relative sizing, contact page, and cleaned up some other minor things that were bothering me. The site still feels "old" but I'm stuck creatively on what to do to bring it up.
