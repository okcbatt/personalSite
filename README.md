<!-- enjoyed the assignment. cant wait to see it evolve as we learn more functionality
also wanted to thank Ed for suggesting coolers. Im super colorblind and that helped picking colors that went together -->

Week 2 - added flexboxes containing my paragraphs alternating the order between each on (left, right, left) for the about me and the portfolio pages to create a better looking page. Also added a background image rather than a solid color (I need to find a better quality picture but this will serve as a placeholder for now). Feeling better with how its looking after week 2 than week 1!
